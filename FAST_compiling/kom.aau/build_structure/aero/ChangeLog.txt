AeroDyn Change Log
------------------

AeroDyn v3.30
 Added capability to read turbulence files in AeroDyn.

AeroDyn v3.50
 For AeroDyn, separate the YawDyn and ADAMS inputs.

v7.70
 AeroDyn version numbering changed so that VFOSUB version matches the
 Aerosubs & YawDyn version number.

v8.10
 Added live twist capability to AeroDyn and brought up to date with
 YawDyn.

v8.20
 For AeroDyn, added dynamic inflow and eliminated FEQUIL option.

v8.30
 For AeroDyn, added parameters to set many array dimensions, no-wake
 option.

v8.3? 02-15-1994  A. Elliott

 Modified AeroDyn for compatibility with ADAMS 7.0  by converting all
 calls to INFO to calls to SYSFNC and SYSARY as appropriate.  Also added
 code to allow calls to these subroutines without calling them during
 the IFLAG pass.  This greatly improves the speed of the code, since
 ADAMS is unable to use the Jacobian information produced by this
 discrete-time implementation of the aerodynamics.

v8.37  30-Jun-1994
 Updated AeroDyn for compatibility with YawDyn 8.37 (no functional
 changes, but minor output and format mods).

v8.38  30-Jun-1994
 Added DTAERO to AeroDyn, the ability to perform aero calculations only
 after time interval DTAERO has passed (instead of every ADAMS time
 step).

v8.41  20-Aug-1994
 Added use of USRMES, the ADAMS utility to write messages to the .msg
 file and screen.

v9.00  10/4/94
 Updated comments and formatting for final release under NREL
 subcontract XF-1-11009-2

v9.01  12/2/94
 Modified to use IEC definitions of wind inputs.  This changes the
 definition of the shear coeffs. and eliminates the old linear vertical
 shear option.

v9.10  12/30/94
 Incorporated Marshall's linear interpolation turbulence routines.  Also
 include several other changes Marshall had made to the code.

v9.20  1/4/95
 Added multiple cl-cd airfoil data tables.

v9.2?  02-Mar-1995
 Changes to AeroDyn to allow passing of variable for interpolation in
 airfoil table with multiple cl and cd values.

v9.3  6/14/95
 Allow printing of selected blade element data.
 Made READFL and STRNGL more robust.
 Added two inputs to .ipt file for aileron power control.
 Renamed POWRLAW to NOIECEWS to emphasize change in definition for IEC
   wind shear.
 Added induced tangential (swirl) velocity calc.
 Added output of hub-height wind speeds to element.plt file.
 Added variable YAWRAT to eliminate singularity problem with Q(4) in
   AeroDyn.
 Modified by Andy Elliott to use INFFNC and INFARY in place of SYSFNC
   and SYSARY.  This avoids functional dependency calc. and the
   Feb 15, 94 workaround of this problem.
 REQSUB changes:
   Include files have been added so that the preconing, pitch, etc. are
     now available from AeroDyn.
   Alpha and Coeff. of Lift added.
   Can give azimuth for both cw & ccw rotation.
   Modified for use of VFORCE in ADAMS v6.0 for REQSUB.
   Modified Debug to print the 'aelement.plt' file instead.  This
     eliminates use of the debug parameter from earlier versions.
   Scaled back to work only with the CER hinge model.  Convert all INFO
     calls to SYSFNC or SYSARY.

v9.31  11/8/95
 Corrected error in output power adjustment for inertial effects in
 AERO sub.  Value Q(1) changed to TEE.

v9.32  11/16/95
 Added CTILT terms to yaw moment calculation to improve accuracy for
 very large tilt angles.

v9.33  11/28/95
 Added yaw rate terms to teeter rotor inertial torque.

v9.34  1/09/96
 Added yaw moment due to FT * flap combination.

v9.35  1/10/96
 Change file unit numbers to get all in range 90-99 for compatibility
 with recent changes in ADAMS.
 Updated AeroDyn to include dynamic stall effects from pitch rate.

v9.50  3/20/96
 Updated to include pitch rate terms in dynamic stall, changed sign on
 inertial power for teetering rotors, improved inertial terms in teeter
 yaw moment.
 Converted RECSUB to INFFNC and SYSARY to INFARY in SENSUB.  Added
 teetering rotor template.  Changed file unit numbers.

v9.51  4/8/96
 Improved expression for teeter rotor yaw moment by adding other two
 inertias and removing many small angle approximations.

v9.52  4/9/96
 Improved teeter equation of motion with more accurate mass moments of
 inertia, removed extra space from RB in variable E5 in YFLAP (no effect
 on results).

v9.53  5/17/96
 Minor modification to teeter rotor torque term to use the more accurate
 inertias and to yaw moment equation for teetering rotor to improve
 accuracy for low teeter angle excursions.

v9.60  6/10/96
 Added error traps for blade element dimension data.

v9.70  6/13/96
 Added pitching moment calculation option.

v9.80  10/29/96
 Implemented new input file format and compatibility with YawDyn Windows
 Interface 'YawWin' (Visual Basic program).
 Converted VFOSUB to GFOSUB to add pitching moment calcs.

v9.81  10/30/96
 Removed Gormont dynamic stall option.

v9.83  11/05/96
 Improved interpolation for F in Beddoes model and added edge aero
 moment to output.

v9.84  11/06/96
 Changed output method to show only those columns of data that are
 pertinent.

v9.85  11/08/96
 Improved tip loss model for large deflections by using DR values
   instead of R - RLOCAL.
 Added pitching moment outputs to REQSUB.

v9.86  11/13/96
 Use double precision azimuth sum (AZIMUTHD).  Better accuracy for very
 long simulations.

v9.88  11/26/96
 Allow longer filenames for airfoil data files.

v9.89  12/5/96
 Modified time-tracking for ADAMS.  No functional change for YawDyn, but
 .inc files and YAWIN and YAWOUT argument lists were changed.
 Found AeroDyn bug that has been present in version 9.5 and later.  DT
 value was not calculated correctly (TEMPTME value updated in wrong
 place).  Effect felt primarily in dynamic inflow calculations, which
 are seldom used.  Also some effect on dynamic stall calculations,
 though generally the effects are small because a default value of
 DT=0.01 sec was used.  Also deleted UPDATE and TEMPTME variables
 because they are no longer used.  DT and OLDTIME updates moved to
 SENSUB.  Added check to verify SENSOR is included in dataset.

v10.00  12/16/96
 Removed 'WRITE(92,...' lines from USRMES and final checks for release.

v10.01  1/15/97
 Fixed 'NOCNTRL' typo and zero CN slope check.

v10.02  2/05/97
 Allow tip loss calc. for station at r/R=1.0.

 Fixed FOILNM size.
 Modified blade element location checking to accommodate use of Gaussian
   integration points (from ADAMS WT).
 Added SAVEs to PRTBLD for Unix systems.
 Fixed FOILNM length in all files.
 Added FIRSTP array to REQSUB to make insensitive to order that ADAMS
   routines are called.

v10.04  6/13/97
 Added check for zero horizontal wind (bypass twr shad) and fixed
 initialization of VLINSHR.

v10.04  8/19/97
 Set value of YAWRAT in AERO subroutine.
 Changed NINT to IDNINT(OLDTIME) near line 340 and initialize OLDAERO in
   PRTBLD.

v10.05
 Replaced PCCHK with PC in PRTBLD radius test.

v10.10  9/29/97  M. Buhl
 Removed ability to read formatted FF wind files.
 Added ability to read binary FF wind files.
 Created a new source file called AeroMods.for.  It contains the FF
   variables that used to be in common.
 Added simulation timing to screen output.
 Added YawDyn version number plus run date and time to top of output
   files.
 Changed some variable names to emphasize the concept of FF vs HH
   instead of the misleading turbulent and not turbulent terms.
 Created a new module for global FF variables.
 Replaced the PAUSE statement with a call to a PAUSE routine.
 Redid or eliminated the string functions to use F90 intrinsics like
   TRIM and ADJUSTL.
 Miscellaneous cleanup and F90izing.

v10.20  10/02/97  M. Buhl
 Added input variable PsiInit to initialize the azimuth.
 Added calculation of hub wind speed and direction.  Added them to .plt
   file.
 Modified the FORMAT statements for the .plt files.
 Removed unnecessary pauses before STOPs.
 Wind file names were moved to a new common block /Strings/.
 New input parameter "PsiInit" was added.  Blade azimuth is initialized
   to that value.
 Eliminated the use of BACKSPACE in YAWIN.
 Miscellaneous cleanup and F90izing.

v10.30  10/03/97  M. Buhl
 Created a new scheme to choose output variables.

v10.34  01/21/98  K. Pierce and M. Buhl
 Added "USE FF_Wind" into GFOSUB.
 Changed AVERWIND to MeanFFWS in GFOSUB.
 Updated INITIAL routine to fix minor bugs.

v10.35  28-Jan-1988  K. Pierce and M. Buhl
 Added UNITCHK subroutine to determine ADAMS system units. CONVFAC is
   used to scale forces returned by AeroDyn.
 Modified GFOSUB to work with v10.3x  AeroDyn.
 Added version and date stamps to all output files.
 Changed all dates to DD-Mon-CCYY format.

v10.36  12-Feb-1988  K. Pierce and M. Buhl
 Fixed output of teeter rate.
 Added output of blade deflections, flap rates and moments for blades 2
   thru MIN(NB,3).
 Reordered output table and added comments.
 Eliminated comments on how to turn code back into being F77 compatible.
   F90 stuff is now ubiquitous; there's no turning back.
 Changed dimension parameter for OutData from MaxParam to MaxCol.  How
   it worked before, we'll never know.
 Minor cleanup to eliminate warning messages.
Change.log created for better version tracking.

v10.37  13-Feb-1998  M. Buhl
 Had to add RECL= parameters to the OPEN statements for yawdyn.plt and
 element.plt so YawDyn would work on the Sun.  Seems to be ignored by
 the DEC compiler on the PC.  We fixed a newly introduced error in
 calculating the out-of-plane load for blades other than one.

v10.38  14-Feb-1998  K. Pierce
 Fixed a newly introduced error in calculating the out-of-plane load for
 blades other than one.

v10.39  09-Apr-1998  M. Buhl
 Changed the record length for the open on UNIT 94 (element.plt) to 2000.
 Also changed format 4000 in the main program to allow 160 labels after the
 first 7.  Also changed format 4100 in main to allow 20*8+6=166 numbers after
 Time.

v11.01 12-Oct-1998  K. Pierce
 Updated the Initial subroutines in gfosub.f and yawdyn.f.  These had
 not been updated since I modified the calculation of parameters for the
 Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model.
Assigned a value to skew in gfosub.f subroutine newtime.  Previously
 skew was not assigned a value during an ADAMS run.
Moved call to vnmod in subroutine elemfrc so that vnmod is called only
 if we are not using dynamic inflow.  This should eliminate the
 possibility of applying a skewed wake correction twice.

v11.02 13-Oct-1998 D. Laino
 Created edge, flap, and pitching moment arrays in AeroDyn.inc, and code
 them in YawDyn.f so output requests for blades 2 and 3 will actually
 provide output.  Code taken from work done by M. Buhl at NREL at an
 earlier date.
16-Oct-1998 D. Laino
 Converted "\" edit descriptors in aerosubs to "$" edit descriptors for
 compatibility with the Sun compiler as per M. Buhl's request.

v11.03 04-Nov-1998 D. Laino
 Corrected improper calculation of induction factor in subroutine VIND,
 so only the wind speed is reduced, not the blade velocity.  This correction
 is likely significant only for configurations with relatively large
 out-of-plane blade velocities such as teetering rotors in severely
 asymmetric inflow conditions.

v11.04 21-Dec-1998 K. Pierce and M. Buhl
 We changed the induction factor calculations to mimic that of WT_Perf.  We
 also added the effects of precone in the VNB and VNW calculations.  We fixed
 the processing of the input data so it initialized the effects of precone for
 teetering and rigid, nonflapping rotors.  We changed the OPEN statements
 in aerosubs.f so that input files are opened with "ACTION='READ'" so that
 both ADAMS and YawDyn could share the same input files at the same time.

v11.05 18-Jan-1999 M. Buhl
 I eliminated the sin(pc)=pc, cos(pc)=1 assumption in the calculation of the
 flap moment for the case of the completely rigid rotor, but commented them out,
 as the equations may not be valid for all cases.  I changed the output format
 for the Element.plt and YawDyn.plt files to use ES12.5 format.

v11.06 24-Feb-1999 M. Buhl
 I modified output of flap angles for hinged blades so that the values no
 longer includes the precone.  Both screen and file output changed.  I
 still have not modified the input of flap angle for the initial values.
 One must still include the precone in the initial flap angles.

v11.07 17-Mar-1999 D. Laino
 Dave made unspecified changes.  He also removed all flap-angle mods
 done in v11.06.

v11.08 24-Mar-1999 M. Buhl
 I put my 11.06 mods back in.  I also changed the flap output to YawDyn.opt
 and the input values to eliminate precone from all flap I/O values.  I also
 increased the precision of the trim flap angle and rate values.

v11.09 25-Mar-1999 D. Laino
 Corrected Marshall's corrections in equation for FMYM to eliminate small angle
 approximations.
 Added calculation of EMYM - the gravity contribution to the edge moment - and
 added its contribution to the yaw moment equation and edge moment output.
 (Still need to add coriolis terms to the edge moment equation.)
 Revisited yaw moment equation and discovered confusing decomposition of
 contributing forces and subsequent missing terms.  Rewrote all these terms in
 a more logical fashion.  Added EMYM and aero pitching moment contributions.
 Changed edge moment output to be the entire aero edge moment (previously it
 was just the component parallel to the main shaft) plus the gravity component.
 Added argument EMOM for edge moment in call to BLDFM.

v11.10 01-Apr-1999  D. Laino
 Changed the sign on the VXY term in the equation for VROTORZ in subroutine VELD.
 The previous positive sign was incorrect and led to serious errors for large
 tilt angles.

v11.11 01-Apr-1999  D. Laino
 Added error checks for zero chord length and excessive Mach number.  Both these
 conditions cause the angle argument in MPI2PI to be NaN, causing an infinite
 loop.  Tried to add error check in MPI2PI using the ISNAN function, but it
 caused YawDyn to crash for an unknown reason that we had no luck tracking.  This
 check is currently commented out in MPI2PI.

v11.12 02-Apr-1999  D. Laino, C. Hansen, A. Suzuki
 Found the DEC compiler OPEN statement commented out in the previous release.  The
 DEC option has been reset to default in this release.  Also found that the version
 output was not updated in GFOSUB statement since v11.02!  Added a Prog argument,
 but still need better means of tracking versions throughout YawDyn/AeroDyn.  Undid
 Marshall's comments in subroutine VIND for better induction factor convergence.

v11.13 08-Apr-1999  D. Laino, A.D. Wright
 After independent verification by Alan Wright, the Coriolis term due to blade flap
 was added to the edge moment equation, and its contribution to yaw moment.
 Note: this Coriolis term neglects effects due to yaw motion.
 Added Module identify to maintain the program names and version numbers.

v11.14 09-Apr-1999  D. Laino, M. Buhl
 Corrected a minor typo in an error message output to the screen.  Also added
 program identifiers to the headings of files output by sample REQSUB.

v11.15 03-Jun-1999 D.Laino
 Added index to PITSAV in subroutine elemfrc, which corrects the output of the
 local pitch angle in file element.plt.  Added check to see if array FFData was
 already allocated before attempting to allocate again in subroutine ReadFF.

v11.16 07-Jun-1999 D.Laino
 Eliminated all version number comments in all distributable files.  The version
 number can be found in Module Identify, in the filename of the distributble
 archive, and here in the change.log file only.

 Corrected logical statements in YAWIN regarding FLAPDOF and TEETER.  These are
 not mutually exclusive, which is what they would have to be for the statements
 to work as they were written.

 Corrected equation for the number of turbulence steps (NFFSteps) in ReadFF to
 include the precone angle.  Added a check between rotor diameter and grid
 dimension in ReadFF. If the grid is larger than twice its minimum required
 size, the turbulence file runs out prematurely.

 Fixed a major bug in the gravity calculation for the edge moment.  The gravity
 term was incorrectly added to subroutine AERO, and was already present in the
 main routine, though it was lacking the tilt term.  The AERO equation was
 corrected and the main routine equation commented out.

v11.17 08-Jun-1999 D.Laino
 Fixed inconsistencies in the reference coordinate system for blade moments.  All
 are now in the blade coordinate system, as a strain gauge would be.  Corrected
 errors with the edge moment contribution to yaw moment.

v11.18 17-Jun-1999 D.Laino
 Corrected sign on coriolis edge moment term in AERO.  Changed back to original,
 more stable equations for induction factor in AXIND.  Changed input and output
 back to including the precone in the value for flap angle.

v11.20 31-Aug-1999 M. Buhl, K. Pierce, D. Laino
 We added the tangential induction factor to the element.plt files.
 We modified ELEMFRC so that we would not get singularities when the blade
 marker is at the center of rotation; FAST_AD can have aero markers there.
 We modified VIND in aerosubs.f to use the old values of a and a' instead of zero
 when we can't converge.  This necessitated saving the old a'.  It also gives a
 better starting guess for the tangential velocity in AXIND.  We added the array
 OLDAP to aerodyn.inc.  In gfosub.f, we modified INITIAL and NEWTIME.
 We modified VIND and AXIND to add VNA, VTA, and PHI to the AXIND argument list
 so we could modify VIND to print them when we don't converge.
 We modified VIND to initialize a with the old a that had not been corrected
 for skewed wake.  We created a new variable (OLD_A_NS) to save the values.
 This sped up a highly yawed case by a factor of 2.5.  Not too shabby.
 We replaced calls to IFIX to NINT because IFIX is not a standard intrinsic.
 Added search for "Grid width" in subroutine ReadFF to handle new SNLWind
 summary file.
 Added check between the number of blades in the ADAMS dataset and yawdyn.ipt
 in GFOSUB.F; created variable IBLDMAX for this purpose.  Prior to this fix,
 if NB was greater than the number of blades in the ADAMS dataset, ADAMS
 would run without ever calling NEWTIME and updating the wind input, yaw
 angle, rpm, yaw rate or beddoes or dynamic inflow parameters.
 Changed Mach number > 1.0 error in ATTACH to warning to avoid aborting during
 ADAMS startup; sets Mach number to 0.7 to continue simulation.

v11.21 03-Sep-1999  M. Buhl, D. Laino
 Removed a DO loop in YAWIN that set QP(I)=QP(I).
 Added variables SINPC and COSPC to aerodyn.inc and calculated them in YAWIN.
 Created SQ1 and CQ1 in AERO.  Rid equations for HFORCEZ and HFORCEY of small
 angle approximations, and added FN term to HFORCEZ equation.  Also got rid of
 small angle approximation for TILT and TEE in equation for YAERO, as well as
 several other equations in AERO.  Added variables CTEE and STEE for this.
 Added normal aero force (FN) term to equation for HFORCEZ.  Why was it missing?
 Changed the error tolerance for the difference in mean wind speeds from the
 full-field summary and binary files from 0.01 to 0.1.
 Removed the term ZMYAW from equations in AERO subroutine.  This term made no
 physical sense and appeared to be redundant with ZMTOT.
 Changed the TEMP variable in BLDFM of yawdyn.f so that it used the SIN(Q(1))
 instead of Q(1).
 Put in calls to MPI2PI for wind direction (probably unnecessary) and yaw angle
 into WrData in yawdyn.f.

v11.22 01-NOV-1999 D. Laino
 Corrected equations for ZGRND in subroutines INITIAL and BLDFM.  It was missing
 the SL term.  Added cosine of flap angle (CQ1) in equation for THRUST in AERO.
 Replaced set of terms with already calculated VNA variable in SWRLARG equation
 in AXIND.  Also returned to original single equation for A2 in AXIND after
 correcting it by moving TIPLOSS variable inside parentheses.  In subroutine AERO,
 added a general equation for the edge moment for both rigid and teetering rotors.
 Also rewrote all terms to the rigid and teetering flap moment equations.
 These equations have been checked using Autolev and ADAMS.  Fixed output to
 always have yaw rate available, since FIXED really means fixed yaw rate (not
 angle). Deleted no longer used subroutine SETWRIT.  Changed the test input
 files' headings and selected output columns.

v11.30  19-Jan-2000  M. Buhl
 I modified READFF so that it looks for the string "snwind" at the top of the
 FF summary file.  If it finds it, it uses a different logic for reading the summary
 file than is used for the old SNLWIND-3D summary files.  AeroDyn now supports
 both types of files.

v11.31 24-jan-2000 A. Suzuki
 Added subroutine VG2ROTOR to convert wind velocity components from ground to
 hub coordinates for use with dynamic inflow and full-field turbulence.
 Previously, large errors in induction factor distribution would result during
 large yaw error conditions.
 Implemented post-stall routines based on UIUC semi-empirical post stall model.
 The current version is not activated in the release version but is present in
 the code for testing and development.  The Post Stall corrections are not proven,
 and are known to not be active when dynamic stall is used.

v11.35 18-Feb-2000 C. Hansen ( search for string CH-- )
 Made numerous small changes in subroutine MPI2PI to avoid infinite loops if
 ANGLE is NaN and avoid round-off errors when PI is defined by DATA statement.
 Changed convergence test for axial induction factor when EQUIL wake option is
 selected.  Now two tolerances are used.  If the error has many zero crossings,
 indicating we are close to a solution, a relaxed criterion is used.  Otherwise
 the original criterion still applies.  This seems to help in cases with
 convergence problems, but may still need further refinement.
 Also added output of Post Stall parameters when this undocumented option is used.
 Finally, edited source files to remove obsolete comments and improve readability.

v11.36 23-Mar-2000 D. Laino
 Corrected error messages for simulation mode and stall model options in YAWIN.

v12.00 (unreleased) D. Laino
 Extensive rewrite of the code to convert to Fortran90.  Included elimination of
the INCLUDE files, and the introduction of new MODULES to replace them.  Nearly
all arrays have been converted to allocatable based on model parameters.
AeroDyn Subroutines have been separated into 3 files now: AeroSubs.f90, and
GenSubs.f90 hold the code, and AeroMods.f90, contains the modules.

v12.10 (unreleased) D. Laino
 The Pitt & Peters dynamic inflow model has been replaced with a Generalized
Dynamic Wake model.

v12.20 (unreleased) D. Laino
 Features added:
 An error.log file is now generated to record any serious warnings or errors
during a simulation.  This file is cumulative, meaning it will add errors from
subsequent simulations until it is manually deleted.  This should prove useful
in running large batches of simulations.
 Other bugs addressed:
 A call to VIND in INITIAL even when WAKE is false has been fixed.  VIND is now
only called if WAKE is true.
 READFL now cycles through all airfoil data files to determine the longest in
order to set NumCL (Which replaces MAXCL) before reading the files.
 Set HH wind file parameters to last values in wind file when simulation is
longer than the wind file.  Previously, the last interpolated values were used,
which may have been slightly different.
 Added rotor torque as an output in YawDyn.  Created variable Torque to replace
POWER in torque calculations which already existed in YawDyn.
 Reduced outputs to screen for program.  Reduced write statements in code.
 Improved error outputs to be more precise.  Added error and warning tally.

v12.30 16-May-2001 D. Laino
 Separated yawdyn.ipt into two files: yawdyn.ipt and aerodyn.ipt.  Created
new variable T_Shad_Refpt for the tower shadow defecit, separating it from
the geometric hub sling variable (SL).
 Created new module AeroTime for the aerodynamic time variables.
 Extensive changes to GFOSUB.F90.  In PRTBLD, PC is eliminated.  Tip-loss
constants are now estimated without it.
 Replaced YAWRAT with YAWVEL (= YAWRAT * SL * CTILT)
 Put ElemOpen and ElemOut in Aerosubs for all AeroDyn programs to use.  The filename
(e.g. element.plt) is now passed in the argument to ElemOpen.
 Changed VINDERR (and call to it) to provide more specific error message.
 Eliminated subroutines PAUSE and WAIT from program.
 Created subroutine BEDINIT to initialize dynamic stall parameters that were previously
initialized in INITIAL (in both YawDyn and GFOSUB).
 Replaced Q array with variable names FlapAng, FlapRate, YawAng and YawRate.
 Created Subroutine SetProgName to write the program ID string.  Created subroutine
OpenOutFile to open each output file and write the program ID string to the
first line.  Added variable Prog to the Identify module to hold the string.
 Removed SL and PC from FF subroutines since these are not defined in ADAMS.  Uses
1.1 * R instead.
 Added check to FF routines to see if HH and Zhub differ by more than 10%.
 Created gateways to the AeroDyn code for dynamics codes to use.  AeroDyn now
requires several subroutines in the dynamics code to provide status of the
dynamics model.  See the User's Guide.

v12.31 14-Sep-2001 D. Laino
 Added Conv2UC routine to GenSubs to make text inputs to AeroDyn case-insensitive.

v12.32 20-Sep-2001 D. Laino
 Eliminated GRAV constant from AeroDyn.  Made NB and TILT output in ADOUT a ADAMSRUN
only event.

v12.33 21-Sep-2001 D. Laino
 Eliminated ADAMSRUN logical from AeroDyn.  AeroDyn now uses the character variable
DynProg (set to 'ADAMS', 'YawDyn' or 'SymDyn') to determine the dynamics routine it
is mated to during a simulation.  A default is set in case other programs are used,
but it does not guarantee errors will not be encountered.

v12.34 03-Oct-2001 D. Laino
 Eliminated rElement and CoverR arrays as they were no longer needed residuals that
were part of the deleted post-stall routines.

v12.35 10-Oct-2001 D. Laino and M. Buhl
 Applied fixes proposed by M. Buhl to GetHHWind for one-line wind files, replacing
IERR with IOSTAT in READ statements.  Added trap for numeric errors after line two
of the wind file.  Other fix implemented to avoid use of data from an incomplete
line in the wind file.

v12.36 10-Jan-2002 D. Laino
 Added check of turbulence UBar (average wind speed) to turn off dynamic inflow
if UBar is <= 8 m/s to avoid rotor brake state errors in the DYNIN routines.
This is a temporary fix for this DYNIN problem.

v12.40 01-Mar-2002 D. Laino
 Added flag to control tip loss model in input file.  Added Geogria Tech
correction to Prandtl model.  Moved tip loss correction calculations to new
subroutine GetTipLoss.  Bypassed read of ATOLER if WAKE option is NONE.

v12.41 12-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Added 'FAST' to list of recognized program names in AeroDyn.  Updated Int2LStr
and Flt2LStr with version from FAST.  Reversed logic for NEWTIME and
GetBladeParams in GetVel for calls from FAST since it works backwards.
 Renamed subroutine Alloc to AllocArrays to avoid conflict in FAST.
 Added routine GetHubWind to supply the wind vector at the hub.
 Added variable DynProgRoot to module Identify.

v12.41b 17-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Phasing in new AD_InputGate with aerodyn input file name argument.
 Added viscosity to the input file.
 Updated PremEOF argument to reflect new routine for eventual use of library of
general routines (someday, somehow).
 Now requiring quoted strings for filenames.  This will permit comments in the
input file.

v12.42 22-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Fixed bug in area weighting calculation of AVGINFL.  It was lost in the
translation to the new interface.  Introduced variable SumInfl to replace
array VIN.  Deleted OLDVIN array as it was unnecessary and was causing AeroDyn
to use AVGINFL from 2 time steps prior to the current (rather than only 1).
 Added "FORM='FORMATTED'" to the OPEN statements in OpenInputFile and
OpenOutFile.
 Fixed ADOut to write HHWindFile name when constant wind is used.  Added
quotes around airfoil file names written to the opt file.  Added air viscosity
line to the opt file.

v12.43 26-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Added Reynold's number calculation to AeroDyn, and output to the element file.
Added option to move between multiple airfoil tables based on Reynold's number.
Set the initial MulTabLoc to default = 0.0 in modules.  It should be set at the
start of a simulation to an initial value by the dynamics code, unless RENUM
option is used.
 Changed dimensions of arrays for element output to reflect number of output
elements rather than total number of elements.
 Changed OpenInputFile routine to open all files read by AeroDyn.
 Set default file unit numbers in module AD_IOParams.
 Put NumFoil in module Airfoil, and changed dimensions on arrays to use NumFoil
instead of NELM.  This effects two things:  It allows the use of more airfoil
files than elements, and it reduces memory allocation when fewer airfoil files
than elements are used.
 Changed MulTabMet dimensions from (NELM, MAXTABLE) to (NumFoil, MAXTABLE).
Changed argument NELM to NumFoil in calls to LOCATE to reflect these new array
dimensions.
 Allocate RMS_SAVE and RMS_SAVE only when needed for DYNIN.
 Changed DYNINIT so it is set based on value of DYNINFL.
 Limited allocation of element output arrays to occur only if element output is
requested.

v12.44 26-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Added flag WrOptFile to control creation and writing of opt file.  Set default
to true, which can be changed by the dynamics program.

v12.45 30-Apr-2002 D. Laino
 Added more robust check for the wind file type in subroutine CheckWindType.

v12.46 23-May-2002 D. Laino
 Made various changes to the full-field code to handle new Bladed file format.
This has no effect on how AeroDyn operates.  Call BedUpdate only when DSTALL is
on.  Set TipSpeed to MAX(r * revs, 1.0e-6) to avoid division by zero in infinit
and infdist.  Fixed call to NEWTIME for FAST to occur at blade 1, element 1 as
FAST now loops forward instead of back.

v12.47 19-July-2002 D. Laino
 Fixed problems with the new Bladed turbulence format rectangular grid offset.
Fixed bug in Reynolds Number calculation (density is not needed when using
kinematic viscosity).  Applied James Shawlers corrections to the GDW model
so the wind in the rotor plane is relative to a wind coordinate system, not a
rotor coordinate system.

v12.48 17-September-2002 D. Laino
 Fixed bug that called GDW routines when Dynin was on even though WAKE was off.

v12.49a-mlb  30-Aug-2002  M. Buhl
 I added the ability to read in 4D wind inflow files in the format used by
  NCAR's Large Eddy Simulation of a K-H wave.

v12.49b-mlb  17-Oct-2002  M. Buhl
 When compiling on a Sun, I found that many literal strings spanned multiple
  lines, which is not normally allowed.  I fixed the strings that I found
  in many routines.
 I also found that in subroutine phis(), hfunc() was declared an integer
  instead of REAL, as it was everywhere else.
 The Sun compiler also complained about raising negative REALs to non-integer
  powers.  I changed the -1.0 real base in aerosubs.f90\fgamma() to a -1
  integer base.

v12.49c-mlb  29-Oct-2002  M. Buhl
 When compiling on Linux with the NAG compiler, the compiler complained that the
  VIX argument string was explicitly declared in aerosubs.f90\VIndErr() instead
  of using the size of the passed argument.  I change it from CHAR(3) to CHAR(*).
 I had to change all the CHAR(5) declarations in GenSubs.f90 to CHAR(8) because
  that was how function CurTime was declared.

v12.49 24-December-2002 D. Laino
 Reviewed and accepted all Marshall's changes to date.  The comments remain at
 this stage for the benefit of Marhsall who has further changes to make.

v12.50 24-December-2002 D. Laino
 Added hub loss model based on the one in WT_Perf.  Set default tip loss and
hub loss constants to 99.0 to avoid inadvertant application of incorrect losses
in simulations.  Changed error codes in Marshall's LES routines to use different
values for different calls to ERRLOG. To avoid math instability in wake
calculations, added if block in ELEMFRC to turn wake off for very low tip speeds
(only after time>20 to get rotor started).

v12.51a-djl 31-December-2002 D. Laino
 Corrected size of character variable Frmt in subroutine VIND.  It was far too
small at only 5, so I increased it to 100.

v12.51b-djl 02-January-2003 D. Laino
 Fixed bug in GetPrandtlLoss to calculate the proper loss.  It was using only
the hub loss constants to calculate the loss, so I added the proper constant
as an argument in the call.

v12.51 13-January-2003 D. Laino
 Tested new code in YawDyn, Fast and ADAMS, and it checked out OK, allowing
for release of the beta code.  Comments are still in the source, and will be
purged before next release, following expected further coding by M. Buhl.

v12.52 20-March-2003 D. Laino and M. Buhl
 D. Laino made changes in ELEMFRC to handle two problems.  First, set A and
AP to zero when RLOCAL < 0.01.  Previously, only A2 and A2P were set, and this
may not have been was sufficient.  Second, set A, AP, A2 and A2P to zero for
GDW for low tip speed cases.  GDW normalizes by tip speed, and results were
suspicious.  Also, set DYNINIT to true when this happens to allow smooth
transition back into GDW when tip speed increases.
 M. Buhl made numerous changes that only affect developers of the code.  These
are spelled out in DevelopLog.txt for future tracking.  Removed all alpha
comments from the code. Changed all occurances of TIPLOSS to LOSS after the
LOSS calculation in AXIND(); Prior to this, the hub loss model did nothing.

v12.53 15-Jul-2003 J. Jonkman and D. Laino
 Jason made a number of changes to the internal workings of the code that effect
developers.  See the DevelopLog.txt file for details.
 Jason added another block to CheckWindType() so that we can read HH files that
don't end in .WND.
 Jason changed a little code in SUBROUTINE AD_InputGate() since newer ADAMS2AD
versions will call this routine instead of the old ADInputGate().
 David rid the code of all WRITE(*,*) type statements since these are not
allowed by Matlab (in which SymDyn runs).  There is one such statement now
in a new SUBROUTINE GenSubs.f90/WriteScreen.  If AeroDyn detects SymDyn,
an alternate WRITE(0, statement is used (though it does not actually write to
anything, as far as I can tell).
 David cleaned up numerous other things in the code, including ridding the
code of size declarations on variables used in system calls (i.e., IOS,
Exists, Sttus).  Fixed format statements in FF_Interp to write errors for
grids that are too small.

v12.54 22-Jul-2003 J. Jonkman
 I changed the declaration of the Exists variables in source file GenSubs.f90
   from LOGICAL(1) to LOGICAL so that the variable works with any compiler.

v12.55 25-Aug-2003  J. Jonkman
 Variables ALPHA and W2 in ELEMFRC were moved to the new MODULE ElemInflow().
Array TI was moved from ReadFF and Read_Bladed_FF to Module FF_Wind, and it
was eliminated from the Read_Bladed_FF argument list.  This was done to allow
access to all three of these variables in FAST.

v12.56 24-Sep-2003  J. Jonkman
 I moved variable ATOLER from MODULE AeroMods.f90/Constant() to MODULE
   InducedVel() to avoid variable name conflicts with FAST.  This required me
   to add USEs of MODULE InducedVel() to routines AeroSubs.f90/ADOut() and
   VIND().  This change does not affect the operation of AeroDyn.

v12.57 29-Sep-2004  J. and B. Jonkman
 We rolled up all the alpha changes into this new version.  We eliminated all
   alpha comments.

v12.58  28-Jun-2005  M. Hand
 We replaced Read_Bladed_FF() with a version that is compatible with the double precision
  used in Simulink.

v13.00.00a-bjj 31-Mar-2010  B. and J. Jonkman
 We added Disclaimer.txt to the archive and added two new files to the 
   SAMPLES folder (for new tower influence features).  
 We renumbered the archive with the new numbering scheme: X.XX.XX
