These binned, rainflow cycle counts were generated by Crunch (v3.02.00c-mlb, 25-Jan-2013) on 25-Jan-2013 at 17:27:03.

These aggregate counts were based upon 30002 records from 2 files.
The peak-finding algorithm was used.

Mean wind speed      = 14.1 (m/s)     
Turbulence intensity = 15.5%

Counts were generated for ranges only.

The [X]-values are the peak-to-peak magnitudes of the rainflow cycles.
The [Y]-values are the rainflow cycles per second for those peak-to-peak magnitudes.

To normalize the count rates so they are comparable to others that used
different bin widths, the rates were divided by the following factors:
	B1_Moop	0.34723	(kN m)
	B1_Mip	0.212	(kN m)

B1_Moop[X]	B1_Moop[Y]	B1_Mip[X]	B1_Mip[Y]
