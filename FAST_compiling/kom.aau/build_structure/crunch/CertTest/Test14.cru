-----  Crunch v3.01 Input File  -----------------------------------------------
Input file for testing Crunch for aggregate analysis of unnormalized 1-D RF cycle counting.  Autodetecting format.

False          Echo:               The flag for echoing input to <root>.ech.
False		Output statistics?
False		Output modified data?

"ES11.3"	Numerical-output format specifier.  See manual for limitations.
True		Output aggregate analysis files?  False for separate analysis files for each input file.
"Test14" is the root name of the aggregate files, if aggregates were specified above.

False       FASTbin:            The flag that indicates if the input files are in FAST binary form.  Considered traditionally formatted if FALSE.  All records will be processed.
1           CTRow:              The row with the channel titles on it (zero if no titles are available of if titles are specified below, ignored if FASTbin is true).
0           CURow:              The row with the channel units on it (zero if no units are available of if units are specified below, ignored if FASTbin is true).
127         FDRow               The first row of data (ignored if FASTbin is true).
0           NumRecs:            The number of data records to read from each file (0 to automatically determine which rows to read and if TEnd>0, ignored if FASTbin is true).
5.0, 605.0  TStart, TEnd:       The start and end times (enter zeros if you want to use all the data records in the file).

0 columns in each input file.
0 columns will be used.
Format for column info is: Col_Title(10 char max), Units(10 char max), Orig_Col_#, Scale, Offset

0 of the output columns are to be modified by the IIR filter.  Next four lines ignored if zero.
0
0 is the type of filter (1-LowPass, 2-HighPass, 3-BandPass)
0.0 is the low cutoff frequency (ignored for low-pass filters)
0.0 is the high cutoff frequency (ignored for high-pass filters)

0 new calculated channels will be generated.
1234567890 is the integer seed for the random number generator (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
Format for column info is: Col_Title(10 char max), [opt]Units(10 char max), Equation.  Put each field in double quotes.

0 channels will have moving averages generated for them.
Format for moving-average info is: "Title" (10 char max), channel #, averaging period

1 is the Time column.
2 is the primary wind-speed column (used for mean wind speed and turbulence intensity, 0 for none)

0 pair(s) of channels will have load roses generated for them.
Format for column info is: Rose_Title(8 char max), 0 degree load, 90 degree load, # sectors

0 columns are to be azimuth averaged.  Next four lines ignored if 0.
0
0 is the number of azimuth bins.
0 is the azimuth column.
True		Output azimuth averages to a file?

0 pairs of columns will have their crosstalk removed.
Format for crosstalk info is: OutCol #1, OutCol #2, XT(1,1), XT(1,2), XT(2,1), XT(2,2).

0 of the output columns are to be modified by the peak finder.  Next line ignored if zero.
0

0 channels will have their peaks and/or valleys listed to a file.  Next three lines ignored if zero.
2		Method of identifying peaks (1: slope change, 2: thresholds)
False	Include the time in the peak-list file(s)?
Format for peak-list info is: Channel, WriteTroughs?, Trough Thresh., WritePeaks?, Peak Thresh.

0 of the output columns will have PDFs generated for them.  Next two lines ignored if zero.
0 is the number of bins.
Format for column info is: Column #, Minimum, Maximum.  If Min=Max=0, autocalculate them.

2 of the output columns will have rainflow cycle counts generated for them.  Next six lines ignored if zero.
1 second is the rainflow counting period.
False		Normalize rainflow cycle counts by bin width?
True		For bins with zero counts, output a space if we are using tab-delimited output?
20 is the number of rainflow range bins.  Use "0" to output the actual cycles instead of binned cycles.
1 is the number of rainflow means bins.  Use "1" to output ranges only.
Format for column info is: Column #, Half-Cycle Multiplier, Max Range, Min Mean, Max Mean.
4 1.0 0.0
5 1.0 0.0
