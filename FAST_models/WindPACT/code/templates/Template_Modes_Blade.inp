{:8.3f}  Steady state angular velocity of rotor (rpm)  [Ignored for towers]
   0.0    Pitch angle for blades (degrees)  [Ignored for towers]
{:7.2f}   Total beam length (m)
{:7.2f}   Rigid beam length (m)
   0.00   End mass (kg)
   5      Number of modes shapes or coefficients
   2      Order of first coefficient
{:4.0f}      Number of input stations for distributed parameters
   1.0    Factor to adjust mass
   1.0    Factor to adjust out-of-plane or tower stiffness
   1.0    Factor to adjust in-plane stiffness  [Ignored for towers]
{:4.2f}{:12.2f}{:12.2f}{:14.0f}{:14.0f}


For the lines of distributed parameters, the first column is the
fractional distance along the flexible portion of the blade.  It must go
from 0 to 1. The second and third columns are the structural twist in
degrees and mass/length in kg/m.  The third and fourth columns are the
flatwise and edgewise stiffnesses in N m^2.

Note: If you intend to export results from Modes to FAST_AD, you must
set both the structural twist and pitch to zero.  FAST_AD needs the mode
shapes in the local principal reference system.  It will convert the
shapes to in-plane and out-of-plane coordinates itself.
